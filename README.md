Abstract : In most of the developing countries, the increasing rate of Carbon emissions is considered as a major cause of concern. India is leading in terms of CO2 emissions as compared to other countries. This study is a preliminary evaluation of the situation of CO2 emissions in Italy, reviewing the international and national literature, using global datasets, and using data mining techniques for analysis and prediction. The study used descriptive methods. It focuses on finding the main potential parameters that affect the concentration of CO2 emissions based on energy resources. To get predictions here machine learning algorithms will be applied.
